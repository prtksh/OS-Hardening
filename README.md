# OS-Hardening

This project focuses on the scripting and GUI of shell/OS hardening (Ubuntu), aiming for a secure system and settings. Objectives of this project are in accordance with synchronous coordination across multiple computers, running from only one script, making the use of the script/GUI easier to be understood by users, and applying settings as independent of one another as possible as to not make the system complix to work with. 
Since this project focuses on the UNIX-based Ubuntu operating system, the script will adhere and be in compliance with the CIS Benchmarks proposed for the OS. 

The script focuses on areas and parts of a system like
- Network Connections
- System Monitoring
- Cron jobs
