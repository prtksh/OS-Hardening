# OS-Hardening

##A. **Introduction**
  This project focuses on the scripting and GUI of shell/OS hardening (Ubuntu), aiming for a secure system and settings. Objectives of this project are in accordance with synchronous coordination across multiple computers (currently implemented in my own), running from only one script, making the use of the script/GUI easier to be understood by users, and applying settings as independent of one another as possible as to not make the system complex to work with. 
  Since this project focuses on the UNIX-based Ubuntu operating system, the script will adhere and be in compliance with the CIS Benchmarks proposed for the OS (Ubuntu 23.04 in this case). 
  These benchmarks provide detailed instructions on how to configure various aspects of Ubuntu to meet best security practices. Although these benchmarks are wiely agreed upon, not every system can fit with the modifications. Hence, the settings and aspects are to be implemented according to the specific system and environment needs.

##B. **Aspects**

  ###The script focuses on areas and parts of a system like
    - Network Connections
    - System Monitoring
    - User Management

  ###To be implemented furthur
     - Cron Jobs
     - Advances networking features
     - Ability to run on other monitors

* Currently this is just a single script written in Python and using Curses as a "GUI" library (leaning more towards the terminal type of GUI for a simpler feel). More features will be added.
