# OS-Hardening

## A. **Introduction**
  This project focuses on the scripting and GUI of shell/OS hardening (Ubuntu), aiming for a secure system and settings. Objectives of this project are in accordance with synchronous coordination across multiple computers, running from only one script, making the use of the script/GUI easier to be understood by users, and applying settings as independent of one another as possible as to not make the system complix to work with. 
  Since this project focuses on the UNIX-based Ubuntu operating system, the script will adhere and be in compliance with the CIS Benchmarks proposed for the OS. 
  These benchmarks provide detailed instructions on how to configure various aspects of Ubuntu to meet best security practices. Although these benchmarks are wiely agreed upon, not every system can fit with the modifications. Hence, the settings and aspects are to be implemented according to the specific system and environment needs.

## B. **Aspects**

  ### The script focuses on areas and parts of a system like
      - Network Connections
      - System Monitoring
      - Cron jobs

  1. Network Connections
     - configuring network settings, firewall parameters
     - to control incoming & outgoing traffic
     - restrict/implement access to specific services in compliance with the organization guidelines and rules

  2. System Monitoring
     - configuring user priviledges and access according ot the org guidelines
     - to check unauthorized access and events

  3. Cron Jobs
     - automated system backups
     - updates and integrity checks

  ### The GUI part of the project is built under the GUI toolkits for C++.
